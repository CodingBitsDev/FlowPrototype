# Flow Prototype
 A not very extensive prototype to ask the question if it is possible to create a browser extension that records, trakcs and replays user interactions on a website.

 To start run
 ```
 npm install
 npm run build 
 ```
 
 And use the dist folder to create a Chrome app based on the folder.

 During development npm `npn run start` can be used to allow faster updates.
